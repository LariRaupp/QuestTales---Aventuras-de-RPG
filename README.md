# QuestTales

**QuestTales** is an interactive RPG story website with multiple choices, developed by me. The idea is to provide an immersive experience where players can explore medieval adventures, make decisions, and visualize these stories through illustrations generated by artificial intelligence.

This website was initially created as a project for the **Imersão Dev with Google Gemini and Alura**, but I plan to continue working on it!

## 📜 Features

- **Story navigation**: Users can move forward and back through different stories.
- **Interactive choices**: Player decisions lead to different outcomes.
- **Smart search**: Users can search stories by keywords, scanning every detail including titles, descriptions, options, and endings.
- **Custom images**: Stories are illustrated with AI-generated images based on choices and outcomes.
- **Responsive design**: Fully compatible with mobile and desktop devices.

> **Note**: The site currently includes only three stories. They were developed as a base during the creation and testing of features. Over time, more stories will be added to expand content and improve the experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure of the site.
- **CSS3**: Styles and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Interactive and dynamic logic.
- **Google Fonts**: “Press Start 2P” font for a retro touch.
- **AI-generated images**: Dynamic illustrations with a medieval RPG feel.

### 🎨 Visual Style

The visual style of the site is designed to evoke a "retro" aesthetic, reminiscent of vintage games, tabletop RPGs, and medieval adventures. Pixelated fonts, parchment textures, and soft colors reinforce this nostalgic atmosphere.

Although the site itself has a classic look, the AI-generated images are more realistic, representing what players might "see" in their minds as they experience the narrated scenes, enhancing immersion.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

You can explore the project online or run it locally.

```

### `index.html`

Houses the main structure of the site. It includes the `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`, and links to the stylesheet (`style.css`) and scripts (`game.js` and `stories.js`).

### `stories.js`

Contains all interactive stories. Each story is an object in an array, including title, description, parts, options, and endings, structured for smooth navigation.

### `game.js`

Controls:

- **Navigation** through stories
- Display of **choices** and outcomes
- **Search** functionality
- Presentation of dynamic images and text based on player decisions

The code is commented to ease maintenance and future contributions.

### `style.css`

All site styles, including responsive behavior, fonts, and layout. It aims for a retro RPG feel with pixel fonts and parchment textures.

## 🔍 Smart Search

QuestTales includes a powerful and intuitive **search system**, allowing players to quickly find stories by specific terms. This enhances immersion and makes story discovery more fluid.

In fact, this search model can be easily adapted by other developers for various types of websites. By adjusting what gets scanned and how results are returned, it works great for e-commerce, blogs, or news sites too.

### Features:

- **Full coverage**: Searches every part of each story:

  - **Story titles**
  - **General descriptions**
  - **Individual story parts** (texts and narrations)
  - **Choice options**
  - **Outcomes and consequences**

- **Text normalization**:
  - **Accent-insensitive**
  - **Flexible spelling**
  - **Case-insensitive**

### How it Works:

The search scans through `stories.js`, filtering content based on the player’s input and returning matching stories.

#### Example:

If the player types “spell”, the search will look for that word in every title, description, choice, and outcome — surfacing stories with magical content.

### Benefits:

- **Immersive browsing**: Find themes, keywords, or familiar story elements
- **Fast response**: Lightweight and quick filtering
- **Language flexibility**: Ignores case and accents

### Reusability in Other Projects

This system is highly adaptable and can be used in:

- **E-commerce**: Search by product name, description, or category
- **Blogs**: Find posts by title, tags, or content
- **News portals**: Filter by keywords or topics
- **Online catalogs**: Search by specs or brand

## 🖼️ Creation Process

1. **HTML Structure**:

   - Set up `header`, `main`, and `footer`, and defined content areas.

2. **CSS Styling**:

   - Created a medieval RPG look using parchment-style backgrounds and retro fonts.

3. **JavaScript Development**:

   - `stories.js` stores story content; `game.js` handles user interaction and story flow.

4. **AI-generated Images**:
   - Each story segment is illustrated using AI, adding visual depth and immersion.

🔮 **Future Improvements**:

- Add more stories and AI-generated visuals
- Refine choice mechanics for even deeper interaction
